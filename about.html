    <b>History Deletion / Prevention </b>
    By enabeling the history permission, the temporary container tabs will
    prevent the creation of new history items for sites/urls which never been
    visited before. (aka. dont have any existing history entries yet). This
    method was choosen, because it is non speculative but still less potentially
    destructive than the alternative of deleting all visits to a visited urls,
    like how the `temporary containers` addons Delete History works.
